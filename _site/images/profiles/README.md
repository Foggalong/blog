# Profiles

When I get a new profile photo I usually make it consistent everywhere (with a few exceptions) at once and then keep it the same for a couple of years (with one exception). My profiles pre-2014 are lost to the sands of time, but here's some info on the ones since then.

## 2014

This photo was taken at one of Anita Chandran's annual christmas parties. Actual photographer unknown and the setup was entirely accidental, but it was the first time I'd had a portrait taken against a solid wall looking relatively presentable. Fun fact about this photo is that I was wearing a jumper that Anita also owned though wasn't wearing, but then she changed into it to show people!

## 2017

This photo was taken at a party at Livvi Stoddart's house my Martha Rhodes, using Sam Varley-Steven's camera. My fun fact about this photo is that I had to photoshop some carrot out of my teeth. There's also another photo in the set where I'm laughing out loud (you can hear it in the photo).

### 2019

This was a professional portrait taken by a university photographer during my first couple of weeks at Edinburgh for use on ID cards. Unlike every other profile on this list, outside university materials it was only used on LinkedIn and later this website for a short time; I'd already started experimenting with my presentation by this time.

## 2021

A new photo to reflect my new way of presenting.
