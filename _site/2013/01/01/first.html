    <p>Hi. Forgive me if I‚Äôm a little rusty. It‚Äôs January the first, seen by most as nice time to refresh and start anew. Let‚Äôs test that. I made 3 resolutions last year, none of which I stuck to for very long. So this time round they‚Äôre coming back and I‚Äôm adding a few more with hope that I‚Äôm more like to succeed in at least one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exercise more and eat healthier.</strong> This always fails pretty quickly just coming down to my own laziness. One year I‚Äôll get it and perhaps that year will be this one. Who knows? Already my exercise ideas of running once a day have been shot down by being ill (try again tomorrow) but the health eating is going okay. I only had three meals today compared to the five of yesterday, so that‚Äôs a good thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Read more.</strong> <em>‚ÄúHow many books have you read this year, Josh?‚Äù</em> Oh a good 7 or 8! <em>‚ÄúHow many books which weren‚Äôt subject reading?‚Äù</em> ‚Ä¶ üò∂ This year I‚Äôm going to try again with the perhaps slightly ambitious attempt to read 50 before 2014. I‚Äôve already got the first one, The Great Gatsby, lined up so I‚Äôll probably be boring you with reviews and thoughts at some point along the line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Write, Blog and Vlog more.</strong> Creating is hard. It‚Äôs probably a good few months since I produced any content and in excess of a year since I produced any <em>good</em> content. I‚Äôll try again this year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Finish The Game.</strong> 2012 was a good year for new things. In April I beta tested Windows 8. A fancy new blue-screen later I discovered Linux in the form of Ubuntu 11.10 and it all escalated wonderfully from there. The amount of programming I was doing went through the roof and now I distro hop on an almost weekly basis. I‚Äôll probably bore you with that at some point. But anyway, I started making a game and would quite like to finish it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get a driving license.</strong> I think I can do this. I have the money now so the only thing stopping me is time which I‚Äôm finding scarce. But it‚Äôs possible!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get into University.</strong> It scares me that this is a thing in my life now but a thing it is. Let‚Äôs see how that goes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That should be enough to keep me going for now. It‚Äôs perfectly possible that these will all fail. It‚Äôs perfectly possible that this will be the last time I blog for another few months. I really hope it‚Äôs not though. 2013, eh? I wonder what this one‚Äôs made of.</p>

<p>-Josh</p>
