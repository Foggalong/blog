    <p>Time once again for another year in review. Like my love of the Bourne series, this comes to you in two parts.</p>

<h2 id="2017">2017</h2>

<p>Reading back over my <a href="https://fogg.me.uk/2017/01/01/the-year-that-was-2016/">2016</a> post it doesn’t feel like much has changed. In fact, it might actually be worse. I’ve spent a large proportion of the last few months feeling unwell, I’m not enjoying my degree, my grades fell short of what I’d hoped for, and if one more person tells me I look tired I swear to god I’m just gonna go to sleep right then and there. It would be dishonest to say there haven’t been successes though.</p>

<p>I ran another 10k (intentionally this time) getting a decent time, and have ran close to a half marathon during training. I’ve played Quidditch better than ever and enjoyed success with Manchester and Yorkshire, both of whom I’m now managing over the 2017/18 season.</p>

<p>Time management has always been a sore spot for me, but over the last year it’s improved in <em>almost</em> every aspect of life. I’ve got better at delegating tasks and asking for help when needed; from moderating subs to running societies there’s no job now where I feel like I’m doing it alone.</p>

<p>Surprisingly I’m also pretty happy with where I got with “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160523142719im_/http://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_5/57255/963605-650-1449563743-baopu_15_yx_112415.jpg">Say thanks, not sorry</a> too. I’m not perfect with it by any means but better and going forward feel it can be integrated into general self-care.</p>

<h2 id="2018">2018</h2>

<p>After two years of not-so-good results I’m determined to recapture the success of <a href="https://fogg.me.uk/2015/12/31/happy-new-year/">2015</a>, so the tactic is changing a little going into this year. With the resolutions I consistently struggle to keep the issue seems to be finding it difficult to form new habits.</p>

<h3 id="loop">Loop</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blogs/loop-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of loop" class="left" width="200px%" /></p>

<p>To help in tracking my sticking to these habits I’m using a great little app called Loop, which is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.isoron.uhabits/">F-Droid</a>. In the weeks running up to today I played around with a few different apps (both FOSS and proprietary) and this was the one that seemed to gel with how I work.</p>

<p>There are three broad areas into which I’m focusing my improvements: academic, creative, and health. Most are pretty self explanatory, but there are a few I want to mention.</p>

<p>Creative writing has really fallen by the wayside over the last few years, especially with prose. I’ve written the occasional poem but I haven’t written prose in a few years now. This year I’m challenging myself to write a side of A4 every day.</p>

<p>Update diary has replaced “The Week That Was”. While I did enjoy the self-reflection writing the blogs gave, it did start to feel more like a chore. My sister got me a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Line-Day-Five-Year-Memory/dp/0811870197">One Line a Day diary</a> last Christmas so I’m just using that now which is working much better.</p>

<p>To make sure there’s an unambiguous win condition, each of these must be completed for 85% of the days in 2018. Thanks to the great stats features in the app I should be able to get consistent feedback on how I’m doing with that.</p>

<h3 id="bigger-goals">Bigger Goals</h3>

<p>Despite the focus on the smaller habits, I do still have some big goals that I want to achieve in 2018:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All assignments completed on time<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Finish year 3 with more than 65%</li>
  <li>Complete NaNoWriMo<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Read more than 52 books <em>and</em> 14,000 pages<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Publish something at least once per week</li>
  <li>Complete a half-marathon</li>
</ul>

<p>Will I succeed in these tasks? Will I make it to the end of the year with my faculties still in tact? Tune in next year to find out!</p>

<p>-Josh</p>

      <p>I had such big plans for this in semester 1 and it just fell apart when the going got tough. Fingers crossed for this semester! <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I last completed it in 2011 which will be 7 years ago as of next years. If I could do it then during A Levels I can do it now during my degree. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The number of books read this year has gone up from 40 to 43. Meanwhile the number of pages has gone down from ~14,000 to ~10,000. I don’t want to fall into using the trap of just reading lots of short books to cheat a success on this goal. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
