<hr />

<p>Josh from the future here; you can find archived copies of the original three website designs these lessons spawned <a href="https://foggalong.github.io/web/first/index.html">here</a>, <a href="https://foggalong.github.io/web/second/index.html">here</a>, and <a href="https://foggalong.github.io/web/third/index.html">here</a>. It’s obvious to see, but the third design morphed into the <a href="https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren">Jekyll theme</a> I use today.</p>
