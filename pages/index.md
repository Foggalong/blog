Welcome to my little slice of the internet pie! Here you can find out a bit [about me](about) and read [my ramblings](blog) on various topics. Below is a rundown of some of what I do both online and elsewhere.

#### Mathematics & Teaching

I'm a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh researching the [efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_linear_algebra) of a [type of algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization#Specific_approaches). As part of this I develop some open source packages to help better explore the problems, including [OctCLA](https://github.com/Foggalong/OctCLA) and [RobustOCS](https://github.com/Foggalong/RobustOCS).

Outside research I have a passion for [teaching](blog/tags/#teaching) and [math communication](blog/tags/#math). My [work profile](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jfogg/) has more details on past teaching activities and experience.

#### Open Source Contributions

Aside from my research, I contribute to a few different open source projects in various capacities. Currently I maintain the [Wren Jekyll theme](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren) (which was many [years in the making]({% post_url 2021-09-01-wren %})), my maths department's [LaTeX stylesheets](https://github.com/Foggalong/edinburgh-math-latex), and the bash utility [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) for Linux.

Of my past work, probably the best known is my work with the [Numix Project](https://numixproject.github.io/). For almost 9 years I helped develop, maintain, and package their [icon themes](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core) for Linux, Android, and macOS. For a while I was helped to maintain [pipes.sh](https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh), an XP-style terminal screensaver.

#### Nightline & Mental Health

Nightline is a charity which supports listening services run by students for students across the UK. They provide an invaluable service which I used when struggling with mental health during my studies. Having graduated, I now serve as a trustee for both the [Nightline Association](https://nightline.ac.uk) and [Edinburgh Nightline](https://ednightline.com).

Aside from this, I've also spoke at events on mental health and my experience, including at Oxford Nightline's [50th anniversary celebration](https://www.oxfordnightline.org/fifty). If you would be be interested in having me speak at your event, please [get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshfogg/)!
