On the theme of maths teaching and outreach, here are some projects that I've worked on previously that are public and free to use. For my writing [check the blog](blog/tags/#math). For specific details on teaching experience, check on my [work profile](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jfogg/) instead.

## Decision Tree Explorable

In the summers of 2020 and 2021 I delivered a mini-course as part of the [Sutton Trust](https://www.suttontrust.com/) summer school on machine learning alongside [Isabella](https://isabelladeutsch.com/) Deutsch. My primary contributions were an R/Shiny app ([code](https://github.com/Foggalong/shiny-decision-trees), [app](https://foggalong.shinyapps.io/sutton-dt)) for exploring an application of decision trees and a series of mini research projects on that and applied maths more broadly.

## Visualisation Workshop

[Materials for a workshop](https://github.com/Foggalong/visualisation-workshop) created for a collaboration between [ICMS](https://www.icms.org.uk/) and [Fife College](https://fife.ac.uk/) as part of their prison education programme. It aims to help learners understand common visualisation types, draw conclusions based on represented data, and and how to identify and critically analyse misleading visualisations.

## Access Mathematics

Within Centre for Open Learning, I've been creating a quarto book that covers content from National 5 and Higher maths that relevant for arts, humanities, and social science students. These are being written following current best practice for creating mathematics notes, and we aim to release them as an [Open.Ed](https://open.ed.ac.uk/) resource; watch this space!

## Sparse Regression

![Lasso Regression, Fate Mousavi (2022)]({{ '/images/blogs/maths/Lasso_Regression.png' | relative_url }}){: class="right" width="120px%" }

These [slides](https://foggalong.github.io/lasso/slides) explain [Lasso regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) at an undergraduate statistics level, originally created for a job interview task. While I plan to turn them into a general resource, in the meantime the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Foggalong/lasso) serves as a nice demo of how to create maths presentations that are more accessible using reveal.js and quarto.

## Computation Notebooks

![Python Code, Thraea19 (2020)]({{ '/images/blogs/maths/Python_Code.png' | relative_url }}){: class="right" width="120px%" }

[Nonlinear Optimization](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/24-25/dpt/cxmath11244.htm) is a masters level course at Edinburgh. Its biweekly computing labs make use of Python scripts, but coding knowledge isn't a prerequisite so not every student is familiar. To help make this more accessible, I worked with the [course organiser](https://webhomes.maths.ed.ac.uk/~agr/) to port the Python scripts to Jupyter notebooks hosted on [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/). The source code for these can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/Foggalong/som-nlo).
