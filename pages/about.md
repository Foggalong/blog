I'm Josh Fogg (they), a 30 year old math student born in [Sheffield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield) in the UK. I did my undergraduate masters at [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) and a PhD in [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh). Now we've got the GCSE French out of the way, here's the fun stuff!

Up in Edinburgh I [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/53836163) long distance, previously with the [Haries](https://haries.eusu.ed.ac.uk/) but now mostly solo with the occasional [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/). I also play quadball with [Kelpies](https://quadballuk.org/clubs/kelpies-quidditch-club) and the [Scottish national team](https://quadballuk.org/programmes/team-scotland). It's such an inclusive sport; I'd never played sports before joining but it's such a fun and welcoming community to be a part of!

Though my dedication to it has fluctuated over the years, I get immense joy out of creative writing. When writing for work allows, I try and make it to the [Summerhall writing group](https://www.meetup.com/suummerhallwritinggroup/) too.  This goes hand in hand with a love of [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/jfogg), particularly speculative fiction, and I'm in a few book groups at [Lighthouse](https://lighthousebookshop.com/).

Given everything else, it's probably no surprise that I love TTRPGs too! In the past I've played classics like [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) and [Pathfinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game), but at the moment I'm part of campaigns run with [Spire](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/spire-rpg/), [Agone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agone), and [Best Left Buried](https://soulmuppet-store.co.uk/pages/best-left-buried) which are a lot of fun. Recently I got back into video games too and am _very_ slowly replaying my entire [back catalogue](https://howlongtobeat.com/user/foggalong).

My time is scattered among all that and  [work stuff](https://fogg.uk) too. This blog amalgamates it all and gives an outlet to waffle on and share something that (I hope) you'll enjoy. So welcome, old friends and new: I hope you enjoy your stay in my little slice of the internet pie! ðŸ˜ƒ
