Like the endings to Young Adult book film adaptions, this blog comes in two parts.

## 2015

In part one I want to talk a bit about the year that's gone, 2015, which was a big year for me in a lot of ways. It saw me recover from the worst bout of mental illness I've ever had, the end of a relationship, I took on more responsibilities at Numix, and I returned to University in Manchester to complete my degree.

Not gonna lie, it has been a lot of hard work, but right now I'm the happiest I think I've ever been. I'm healthy in both body and mind which hasn't been true for years and years now, I'm doing well academically, and I have more friends & fun than past me could have ever dreamed of.

My resolutions for 2015 were pretty straight forward: _get better, get organised, get back_. On all three accounts I'm very happy with the results and while I know it's not the end of the story, I really feel like it's made a positive impact on my life for good.

## 2016

With last year having a focus on the big picture and getting life back on track, I want this year to be more on tweaking the small things I've wanted to fix for a while.

1. **Say Thanks, not Sorry**. Can't remember who [shared this](http://web.archive.org/web/20160523142719im_/http://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_5/57255/963605-650-1449563743-baopu_15_yx_112415.jpg) with me, but it's definitely something I've picked up over the last few years, and it wouldn't hurt to fix it.

2. **Learn Another Language**. One of my biggest regrets is dropping learning a language when it was no longer mandatory in Y9. I'm gonna be using [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) to try and put this right.

3. **Exercise & Health**. Now I've got to this place in my life, I need to stay here. Keeping up the routines I have in place and adding new ones in too (yay flossing! /s).

4. **Read & Review 52 books**. It's getting to the point now where I'd struggle to legitimately call myself a reader of books. It's a challenge, but I'll give it a good crack.

5. **Write & Document**. Writing and art became a tool for getting better over the last year, now I want to turn it back into something I can love doing for pleasure.

No doubt I'll be updating on my progress throughout the year on here, but for now thanks for reading and happy new year!
