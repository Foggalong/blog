#### Aka: What I've Learned as Games Coordinator

I've mentioned it in passing, but never as it's own post: I play Quidditch. For the uninitiated see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle_Quidditch) or [this quick rundown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz7_ukX3pyU) by the Manchester club President. I play for [Manchester](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterQuidditch/) and represented them at the [British Quidditch Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Quidditch_Cup) (BQC) in 2016 & 2017. Sport was generally a dislike at school but Quidditch is so much fun! Now I'm out in a field twice a week and at the fittest I've been in my life. The community is super welcoming and the spot generally [aims to be &nbsp;inclusive](http://www.usquidditch.org/about/title-9-3-4). I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone: if it sounds like your bag, [click here to find your local club](https://quidditchuk.org/clubs/find).

Over the last year I've been Games Coordinator for Manchester which has meant talking to other teams to organise events, [friendlies](https://www.facebook.com/events/298431277195997/), and [tournaments](https://www.facebook.com/events/745565238934431). On the whole it's been great fun and a brilliant learning experience, but it's also taught me that the sport is at an awkward stage of development. There's a bit of a rift forming between those teams & players who are becoming super competitive, those who are still very much only in it for the fun, and betwixt a very blurry line.

This year I'm making the big step up and planning on running for President. As a team we're also split between competitive & casual so it's something I've been looking for a solution to. At the team level [Sheffield](https://www.facebook.com/sheffieldquidditchclub/) dealt with this well by recruiting hard and setting up both a first and a second team. This allowed everyone to play at their own pace but kept fluidity between the two. A solution bandied about for the national level is to replace BQC with a multi-tiered league with relegation & promotion ([e.g.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system)). Both of these are no small feat to achieve, and the only answer I've got so far is that there's no easy solution.

Something new this season is the [Quidditch Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_Premier_League) (QPL) which had selective tryouts for every team involved. In theory this should mean QPL has no split, but I have a feeling it'll still be there. From what I've heard, Northern teams were slightly under-applied while Southern teams were massively over-applied. I'll be representing [Yorkshire](https://www.facebook.com/QPLRoses/) so I'll be keeping an eye whether that disparity has any impact. Nonetheless it's set to be a fun summer, and I'm very much looking forward to it!
