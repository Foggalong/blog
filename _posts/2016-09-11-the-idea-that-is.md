## The Week That Was: 16-09-05

I want to start a new thing where I talk about some of the stuff I've been up to over the past week. The idea is shamelessly inspired by [Vi Hart](http://vihart.com/vi-hart-weekly-september-11-2016/) who's amazing mathemusician educator you should definitely have in your life.

### Where I've Been

I've moved into a student house in Manchester which is exciting! I've lived in student accommodation before but this is my first time in a house. It's really nice and I'm loving my room. My friends move in next week and I'm super excited to see them all after a summer of having not.

### What I'm Hearing

I'm currently training for a 5k run in October so at the moment my music time is when I'm out jogging. This week it's been [The Lives of Dexter Peterson](https://open.spotify.com/album/3b9xueKiZS9TMiYvdYCrbQ) by [Matthew Ebel](http://matthewebel.com/). It's generally good fun nerd rock, and I in particular like "I Wish I Were" and "Frozen Oasis".

### What I'm Playing

One of my favourite games from the DS era was [New Super Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Super_Mario_Bros). It was my introduction to Mario platformers and I played it so much that at my peak I could finish the main story in under 45 minutes. When the 3DS rolled around I gave [the sequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Super_Mario_Bros._2) a bash but it never got quite as much love as the original. This has been remedied over the last week when I've been pleasantly surprised at how tricky the last few hidden goals are to work out.
