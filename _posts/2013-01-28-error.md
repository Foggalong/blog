#### 22:32

I was in a good mood today. I was going to talk about how exams have gone, some programming work I've been doing, exercise and relationships. And then I've gone and corrupted my hard drive losing 120GB of files, photos, music and video which I've been transferring over to it over the last few days. This has literally ruined my week.

#### 23:26 UPDATE

My saviour has come in the form of a three month old backup I made to an external hard drive. We'll see soon enough how good the data is but it looks like everything is going to be okay. It might take a few days to get everything back where it was but that's better than nothing.
