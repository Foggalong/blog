I saw one of those good ol' question posts on Tumblr called ["65 Questions You Aren't Used To"](http://fueledbyjyler.tumblr.com/post/78153547750/65-questions-you-arent-used-to). I'm not always a big fan of these kind of things, but this one seemed quite cool and I fancied writing something on this train journey, so here we go!

#### 1. Ever doubt the existence of other people?

My existence is pretty much constantly flipping between this and a state of [sonder](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder), and I'm okay with that.

Depends almost entirely on whether I'm having a good day or not, but I used to be absolutely terrified.

A time-travelling me from the future. I can't imagine it being especially good news.

It changes on a frequent basis, but one I love and feel is consistently underutilised is [overmorrow](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/overmorrow) which means "the day after tomorrow"

#### 5. If you were a type of tree, what would you be?

Sequoiadendron giganteum. Not only are they [massive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_giant_sequoias) but they can also live for a [really long time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_trees#Individual_trees_with_verified_ages).

"When was the last time you shaved?"

#### 7. What are you wearing?

I'm wearing my blue t-shirt from the 2016 British Quidditch Cup and a check shirt over the top. On my way to [Sam's 18th birthday](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ptV07Y2tzSLu9I4bMGAiw)!

#### 8. How do you label yourself?

Mathematician, Writer, Gamer & Computer Type. Not necessarily in that order.

#### 9. Bright rooms or dark rooms?

Bright every time.

#### 10. What were you doing at midnight last night?

Out with two veterans from a society I've just been elected onto the committee of, gleaming some advice for the coming year and generally having a great time. Plus cocktails!

#### 11. Favorite age you’ve been so far?

Twenty: it's the age that brought me back to Manchester, discovering Quidditch, joining CAOS, and a return to great health.

#### 12. Who told you they loved you last?

My dad, when I told him I'd be coming home for the weekend.

#### 13. Who's your worst enemy?

A girl who was in my classes from Y7 to Y11. While a lot of people contributed, she played a big part in ensuring life was very uncomfortable during that time.

#### 14. What is your current wallpaper?

[This one](http://i.imgur.com/w7iGqQf.png) by [Simple Desktops](http://simpledesktops.com/browse/desktops/2015/jun/16/pattern/). I use it on everything from phone to desktop.

[Man or Muppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRTjksM3YAs). Haven't seen the movie but love the song.

Isn't this button just a [UCAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_combat_aerial_vehicle)?

#### 18. Who would you like to punch in the face?

I probably wouldn't punch anyone in the face, but someone I find infuriating instead: I had an ICT teacher who managed to lose my (and several other students) entire coursework for the subject twice, and refused to admit any blame. He then came over on results day and said he was disappointed with my results.

Apparently whisky is something people invest in now?

A cuddly toy dog called Rufus which I've had for most of my life.

#### 31. You can erase any horrible experience from your past. What will it be?

If we're talking about erasing the memory of experience, then I'll say that from first hand experience memory loss isn't as pleasant as it might seem. If we're talking about erasing the experience itself then probably just all of Y7.
