Learning HTML has been on my to do list for a few years now, first cropping up when I became aware of programming languages as a thing. Back then it wasn't really about HTML more about this new and interesting thing which had come into my world. Through a cipher cracking competition I became part of (and also recommendations from friends) python 2 became the language that I learnt. In the years that followed this moved onto python 3, Linux, perl, lua, bash, ruby and a whole array of different tools. It is only now that I come back to HTML and it feels right. I wanted to get back into blogging again and rather than following my old path of setting up an easy blogger or wordpress I thought I'd throw myself in completely and learn HTML(5), CSS, PHP and Javascript to achieve my goal. For now I'm following the simple lessons on [HTML.net](http://html.net) which have been brilliant.

Josh from the future here; you can find archived copies of the original three website designs these lessons spawned [here](https://foggalong.github.io/web/first/index.html), [here](https://foggalong.github.io/web/second/index.html), and [here](https://foggalong.github.io/web/third/index.html). It's obvious to see, but the third design morphed into the [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren) I use today.
