## The Week That Was: 17-02-13

Another few weeks have passed and they've been full of new things!

## What I've Achieved

Results for semester 1 have finally come out and I passed with a solid 2:1. A module I thought I'd done terrible in actually went really well too, so that's always nice!

## What I've Read

My book for about the last month has been [The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250729.The_Vanishing_Act_of_Esme_Lennox) by [Maggie O'Farrell](http://www.maggieofarrell.com/). I don't really want to say too much about this because anything I say will be a spoiler, but would definitely recommend it.

## What I've Organised

Most of my free time over the last month has been spent organising the [Cottonopolis Cup](https://www.facebook.com/events/745565238934431), a Quidditch tournament [my team](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterQuidditch) hosts each year.
