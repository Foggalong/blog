This weekend was to be the 7th in a series of 8 weekends where I had something major on, usually involving travelling to somewhere outside Manchester. I was supposed to be heading off for a conference in Durham but plans had to change: I've had food poisoning since Monday! A turkey take-away pizza so I should have known better, but I'm disappointed nonetheless.

Either way, not going has given me some time to sit and reflect on the other things that have been going by the wayside and (now the illness has cleared up enough I can function) generally catch up on missed work. There's a few things that have happened since I last did a WTW that I'd like to talk about, I'm gonna do an individual blog for each of those. Keep an eye out for them over the next week so you might end up hearing about them at some point.
