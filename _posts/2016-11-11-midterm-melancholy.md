## The Week That Was: 16-10-31

Back on the week that was wagon, here's a summary of what's been going on in my life.

### What I've Done

Honestly it's mostly been revision. Reading week is never really a reading week for maths because they give us midterms. It hasn't gone too great to be honest, having a real feeling of being [too old for this shit](https://xkcd.com/447/).

### What I've Heard

Not too much on the music front this week, most been catching up with some podcasts. If you aren't already you should really be listening to [Dear Hank and John](https://soundcloud.com/dearhankandjohn). Super funny dubious advice podcast about death from [the Brothers Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_brothers).

### What I'm Playing

In preparation for N++ coming to Linux I've been replaying the original [N](http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/nv2.html) (subtitle is "[Way of the Ninja](http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/)" for searchability) between revision sessions on society meetings. I played hours upon hours of this game during secondary school and even though it's probably 5+ years since I last played it I still have the tricks for a few of the levels memorised. The brain is really weird in what it chooses to remember.
