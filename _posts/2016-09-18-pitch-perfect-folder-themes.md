## The Week That Was: 16-09-12

This is a new thing I'm trying where I talk about a few of the things I've been up to over the past week.

### What I've Done

This year I'm trying to go without bus travel and go between lectures and society stuff by bike instead. Manchester is a pretty good city for this because as well as being fairly flat they've done a lot of work [improving cycle lanes](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchesters-cyclists-welcome-new-dutch-10129116).

### What I've Made

Over the last week I've been working on a folder theme for the Linux distro [Budgie Remix](http://budgie-remix.org/). It's based around the great work [Same Hewitt](http://samuelhewitt.com/) did with Moka and honestly I'm quite please with how it's going. It's still a work in progress but there's a peak of what it looks like above, and here's the [source repo](https://github.com/budgie-remix/pocillo) if you're so inclined.

### What I've Heard

This weeks jogging album has been the [soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/6FZKxjroP3z7cvnbSeJbxy) to the film [Pitch Perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_Perfect). Despite its many problematic flaws I did quite enjoy the film, but mainly because I love a capella. Running along and finishing with the [Breakfast Club air fist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkVjkvaeFnQ) has been good fun.

### What I've Played

After finally getting my [Xeox controller](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Speedlink-Gamepad-DirectInput-vibration-function/dp/B008XZ1EMM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474239536&sr=8-1&keywords=xeox+controller) working [on Linux](https://github.com/Foggalong/.files/blob/master/config/xeox-init.sh), I've been testing it out with a game called [Bit Blaster XL](http://store.steampowered.com/app/433950/). It's essentially [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) taken to its logical extreme and damn it's so much fun to play. It's a relatively simple concept but it has enough tricks up those sleeves that I've kept coming back for more.
