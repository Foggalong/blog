_This post served as my about page from the blogs inception in late 2014 up until June 2017. During this time it received pretty much no updates._

![Me circa 2014]({{ '/images/profiles/2014.png' | relative_url }}){: class="left" width="200px%" }

My name is Joshua Fogg and I am 21 years old. I was born in Sheffield in the UK and have recently moved to Manchester where I am pursuing a Mathematics masters degree. I'm a Mathematician, Writer, Amateur Musician, Gamer and Computer Type - but not necessarily in that order.

I guess the best way to describe me would be a nerd. Or a geek, or whatever the going word is these days. Though I don't subscribe to every part of nerd culture (as if that would even be possible) it is the category in which a lot of my interests fall: I was indeed in AV club, Glee Club and even the Chess Team.

On a more serious note I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Until about three years ago I was all set to bundle myself off to film school and become a writer. Before that I wanted to do Special Effects and a multitude of other odd things. Since then I fell for the alluring mistress that is mathematics and have found myself wandering in the world of scientific academia.

All these colourful (and not so colourful) aspects of myself need an outlet and I thought this was the perfect chance to give them one. The stories, the papers, the reviews and the blogs will all find them selves here - my own little slice of the internet pie. So welcome, old friends and new, to me. I hope you enjoy your stay.
