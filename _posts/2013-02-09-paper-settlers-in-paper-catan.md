I made a Settlers of Catan set out of paper because I can't afford to buy it right now, don't have access to a set and wanted to play it tonight. So much paper. It's got the extra bonus in that it can just be expanded on with more paper for as many people as want to play.

But it felt like I just pirated something which was weird. It got me thinking about 3D printers being used to pirate people's products in future. PirateBay will be used to download physical things. Weird.

The future is going to be interesting.
