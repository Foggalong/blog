A year or so ago I started making plans to move away from gmail. I had 3 main reasons for doing this:

1. It was part of a wider move I made to use less Google products. I'll probably write more about another time since it has been a pretty radical shift.
2. I didn't really trust Google to handle my privacy, especially with regard to email.
3. I wasn't a fan of gmail functionality wise and thought I could have something closer to my desired workflow elsewhere.

This particular move involved downloading offline copies of all my archived email and then deleting everything from gmail. I still kept using the service, but as soon as a new email was received it was either deleted or downloaded and then deleted.

The idea was that when I had the time to change email provider I'd then upload all the `.eml` files so that my message history was preserved. This as you've probably gathered didn't go to plan. The email provider I was all primed to switch to unexpectedly shut down, and this has left me looking for another.

I haven't found one that I've fancied yet, and points 1 & 2 are still things that I want to address. In the mean time, I have managed to address 3 in a satisfactory manor using some tools I hadn't realised existed. With that I've decided, at least for the time being, I'm going to gmail.

It's not so much me as my emails. I had several thousand `.eml` files in storage, and they've all gone back onto gmail under the new workflow. It's not ideal and certainly not what I wanted out of this exercise, but to be honest I'm just getting tired of messing around. Though if anyone does have any suggestions for email providers [drop me a message](http://twitter.com/Foggalong), because it could be I've just missed the one.
