## The Week That Was: 17-01-02

### What I've Done

Revision, but unfortunately not enough to feel prepared in the slightest. Hopefully something will click over the next week though. It's a bit scary working through the questions and papers not knowing if it will, but there's not really much else that can be done. Thankfully from next semester onwards I'm be able to pick all my own modules. Naturally I've gone for all the stuff I enjoy and can do well: pure & programming from here on out!

### What I've Heard

Mostly just prebuilt revision playlists this week, but I did stumble across the new song [Castle on the Hill](https://open.spotify.com/album/5YnGwVQx2OQ4CpcQeVDthP) by Ed Sheeran which was a pleasant surprise.

### What I've Read

Finally finished the [Artemis Fowl series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_Fowl_(series)) by Eoin Colfer. I loved them as a kid but by the time the final two books came out my reading had all but stopped so I never got to find the conclusion. Was the ending worth the (for me) nearly decade long wait? Probably not, but I did nonetheless enjoy rereading the series which is always nice for something from childhood.[^1]

### What I've Played

A game I love on my PC is BitBlaster XL. I'm not sure if I've talked about it before but to get an idea of what it's like think Asteroids on steroids. This week I happened across [the Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NVS.bitblaster). It's not quite as full featured featured as the desktop one but still bags of fun and great for passing a spare moment two.

[^1]: I'd planned to do a similar thing with the [Alex Rider series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rider) where the same thing had happened, but to my surprise I found that Anthony Horowitz is still writing them.
